## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, particularly how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this repository, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with data structures and algorithms
- Basic understanding of probability and statistics

## Core NLP Concepts

### What's NLP ?

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language.

### What's Natural Language ?

A natural language or ordinary language is any language that occurs naturally in a human community by a process of use, repetition, and change.

### What's Machine Language ?

A Machine Language Used to translate a given set of mathematical operations that tell the machine exactly what to do. Unlike natural language, Machine language need interpreter or compiler

### Practical Applications OF NLP

- Search (web, documents and autocompletes)
- Edit (grammar controller and spelling corrector)
- Dialog or QA (chat machines)
- Text mining (summarization, knowledge extraction and medical prediction)
- Creative writing (plays, films, poetry, and music)
- Email (Classification, prioritization and spam filtering)
- Behavior prediction (marketing, finance, etc.)

### Some EX For NLP Apps

- QA in websites or chat machines
- Extract date and place information from an event mail and send that to calendar
- Analyzing user sentiment in their reviews about a product, for example a camera, to understand whether the product is of good quality or not.
- machine translation for example that can translate english to persian & also help translators with auto complete suggestions

### The frontiers of knowledge in NLP

#### Mostly solved

- Spam detection
- part of speech
- Named entity recognition (NER)

#### Making good progress

- Sentiment analysis
- Coreference resolution
- Word sense disambiguation
- Parsing
- Machine translation (MT)
- Information extraction (IE)

#### Still really hard

- Question Answering (QA)
- Paraphrase
- Summarization
- Dialog

### - Approaches -

### Rule based:

Decision making is based on a set of rules. The most basic approach.

#### ex : To find a person's date of birth, search for phrases like "born on" or "date of birth."

### Probabilistic:

Any linguistic phenomenon can be modeled by a probability distribution. They are still used

#### ex : N-gram models, These models estimate the probability of occurrence of a sequence of N words based on the number of times this sequence has been seen in a large text.

### Basic AI/ ML:

This method has been used since AI was formed.

### Deep Learning:

Since 2012, DL has taken on a new form, one of the best ways to solve challenges in NLP. Some DL methods are based on Probabilistic
